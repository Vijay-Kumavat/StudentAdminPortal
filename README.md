# Full Stack Application : StudentAdminPortal
This is a full stack application developed using Angular 15 for the frontend and ASP.NET Core 7 for the RESTful Web API backend. The application serves as a real-world example showcasing the integration of these technologies to build a modern and responsive web application.

# Features
  - Angular 15: The frontend is built using Angular 15, a powerful and popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic single-page applications. It provides a robust set of tools and features for creating a rich user interface.
  - ASP.NET Core 7: The backend is developed using ASP.NET Core 7, a cross-platform and high-performance framework for building web applications and RESTful APIs. It offers a wide range of features and capabilities for creating secure and scalable server-side applications.
  - RESTful Web API: The backend exposes a RESTful API that allows communication between the frontend and the server. It follows the best practices of REST architecture to provide a standardized and efficient way of exchanging data.
  - Database Integration: The application seamlessly integrates with a database system (e.g., SQL Server) to store and retrieve data. The database is accessed through the backend using a data access layer or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework.
  - Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This ensures an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  - Deployment: The application is deployable to various hosting environments, including cloud platforms like Azure and firebase. Deployment configurations and instructions are provided to facilitate smooth deployment and scalability.

# Prerequisites
  - Node.js and npm: Required for running the Angular frontend.
  - .NET SDK: Required for building and running the ASP.NET Core backend.
  - Database Server: Install and configure the appropriate database server (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and ensure it is accessible.
